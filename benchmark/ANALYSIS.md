# FFTA.jl performance analysis: implementation gaps vs. structural limits

This document separates the reasons FFTA.jl is slower than FFTW into
**implementation gaps** (fixable inside FFTA's current design) and
**structural limits** (consequences of being a pure-Julia, recursive,
size-generic implementation), and gives a realistic ceiling per size class.
All measurements are from `benchmark/suite.jl` and a set of targeted
experiments on the machine described in [`REPORT.md`](REPORT.md)
(aarch64 Neoverse-N1, Julia 1.12.6, FFTW 3.3.11 single-threaded, `ComplexF64`
unless stated). Ratios are *FFTA time / FFTW time* for planned execution.

## 1. Executive summary

| size class (`ComplexF64` unless noted) | today, vs FFTW `ESTIMATE` | dominant cause | fixable? | realistic ceiling |
|:--|--:|:--|:--|--:|
| 2^k, in cache (n ≤ 2^16) | 2.3–4.4× (7× at 32) | scalar radix-4 recursing to 2/4-point base cases; twiddle recurrence seeded per call | mostly | 1.3–2× |
| 2^k, memory-bound (n ≥ 2^18) | 1.0–1.5× (2.5–3× vs `MEASURE`) | FFTW `ESTIMATE` is itself 2.2–2.8× off FFTW's best here; FFTA has no cache-blocked large-n algorithm | yes | 1.2–1.5× vs `MEASURE` |
| smooth 2^a3^b5^c7^d | 2.6–15× (geomean 7.3×) | O(n²) leaves for 5 and 7 that recompute `sincospi` twiddles per row per execution; no codelets | yes | 1.5–3× |
| primes < 73 | 6–11× | O(n²) DFT with per-execution twiddles | yes | 1.5–3× |
| primes ≥ 73 | 3–9× | Bluestein padded to 2^k, chirp + its FFT recomputed and re-allocated on every call | yes | 1.5–3× |
| prime × small factor | 3.4–11× | as above, inside a composite | yes | 1.5–3× |
| `rfft` 1D | 1.4–7× pow2, 3–25× smooth | already half-size complex; inherits the complex gap + `*`-only API (allocates) | yes | 1.5–2.5× |
| 2D / 3D `fft` | 1.8–15× (worst at small sizes) | per-pencil overhead, copies through per-call buffers, no threading | yes | 1.3–2× (1 thread) |
| 2D `rfft` | 6–25× | full complex transform + copies | yes | 1.5–2.5× |
| batched `dims` | 1.2–5.8× (`fft`), 1.4–10× (`rfft`) | `rfft` along `dims` goes through `mapslices` | yes | 1.3–2× |
| `Float32` | no faster than `Float64` | no SIMD anywhere | partly | see §5.3 |
| vs FFTW with 8 threads | 7–20× | no threading | yes for ND/batched | ~1.5–2× |

The one-line version: **nothing in FFTA's algorithmic approach forces a 10×
gap**; every ≥ 4× class above is an implementation gap. What is structural is
the last 1.3–2× on cache-resident sizes, which is the price of not having a
SIMD codelet library, and a bounded compile-latency cost if FFTA generates
its own.

## 2. What FFTA does today

* **Planning** (`CallGraph{T}(n)`, `src/callgraph.jl`): `n` is recursively
  split. Powers of 2 and 3 become single leaf nodes (`POW2RADIX4_FFT`,
  `POW3_FFT`); primes become `DFT` (n < 73) or `BLUESTEIN` (n ≥ 73) leaves;
  anything else is a `COMPOSITE_FFT` node split into `N1 × N2`, where `N1` is
  the full power of 2 or 3 if present, otherwise the product of prime
  factors closest to √n. Each composite node owns an `n`-element workspace.
  Planning is cheap (microseconds) and never measures anything.
* **Execution** (`src/algos.jl`): `fft!` dispatches on a node-type enum at
  run time. `COMPOSITE_FFT` is textbook Cooley–Tukey: N1 sub-transforms of
  size N2 into the workspace, twiddle multiply, N2 sub-transforms of size N1
  into the output. `POW2RADIX4_FFT` is a recursive decimation-in-time radix-4
  with 2- and 4-point base cases. `POW3_FFT` is recursive radix-3. `DFT` is
  the O(n²) sum. `BLUESTEIN` pads to the next power of two ≥ 2n−1 and does
  three `POW2RADIX4` transforms.
* **Twiddles**: nowhere stored. Every kernel seeds Singleton's recurrence
  with `singleton_params(...)`, which calls `sincospi`, then steps it. The
  `DFT` leaf does this once per output row; the composite node once per
  `j1`; the radix-4 and radix-3 kernels three/two times per recursion level.
* **Real transforms**: 1D even-length `rfft` uses the standard
  half-length complex trick (two real sequences packed into one complex
  transform, then a butterfly). Odd lengths and 2D real transforms run a
  full complex transform and discard half. `rfft`/`irfft` plans implement
  only `*`, not `mul!`; along `dims` of an N-d array they use `mapslices`.
* **Multidimensional**: transforms along each dimension by copying each
  pencil into a contiguous buffer, transforming, and copying back. The two
  buffers are allocated per call.
* **No threading, no SIMD, no in-place (`plan_fft!`) plans.**

## 3. What FFTW does that matters here

Looking at the plans FFTW's `ESTIMATE` planner actually chose on this
machine (`FFTW.plan_fft(x)` prints them):

* Sizes ≤ 64 (and many "twiddle" steps) are single **codelets**:
  `n1fv_5_neon`, `n1fv_13_neon`, `t3fv_32_neon`, `n1fv_128_neon`, …. These
  are straight-line C functions generated offline by `genfft`, with all
  twiddles folded to constants, common sub-expressions eliminated, and
  operations scheduled for the target's register file. The `v` variants
  operate on two transforms (or two halves) at once so that a 128-bit NEON
  register holds a full `ComplexF64`.
* Power-of-two sizes are one or two radix-32 twiddle passes on top of a
  64- or 128-point codelet: `4096 = t3fv_32 ∘ n1fv_128`. There is no
  recursion below 64.
* Composite sizes use the same machinery with mixed radices:
  `1000 = t3fv_25 ∘ t3fv_5 ∘ n2fv_8`, `720 = t3fv_20 ∘ t1fv_6 ∘ n2fv_6`.
* Primes: **Rader** for 61, 73 and 65537 (n−1 is smooth), **Bluestein** for
  127, 1009, 4099 — padded to a *smooth* length (1009 → 2025 = 3⁴·5²,
  4099 → 8640), not a power of two, and with the chirp's transform stored in
  the plan.
* `rfft` uses dedicated real-input codelets (`r2cf_*`, `hc2cfdftv_*`), i.e.
  it does not go through a complex transform at all.
* With `MEASURE`, the planner additionally *times* candidate decompositions.
  On this machine that buys FFTW 1.1–1.8× over `ESTIMATE` for cache-resident
  powers of two and **2.2–2.8× for n ≥ 2^19** (see `REPORT.md`,
  "FFTW.MEASURE" table): the measured plans pick decompositions that make
  fewer passes over DRAM. Below the cache size most of FFTW's advantage is
  the codelet library and the heuristics, not the measuring; above it, the
  measuring matters.

## 4. Implementation gaps (fixable)

Each item quantifies the cost with a targeted experiment and says what the
fix looks like. Items are ordered by expected impact on the benchmark suite.

### 4.1 Twiddle factors are recomputed on every execution

`singleton_params` costs a `sincospi` (tens of ns). The `DFT` leaf calls it
n−1 times per execution; for n = 5 that is the entire cost of the transform:

| n | FFTA today | same loop with a precomputed table | FFTW codelet |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 5 | 172 ns | 37 ns | 23 ns |
| 7 | 292 ns | 74 ns | 28 ns |
| 11 | 612 ns | 191 ns | 42 ns |
| 13 | 807 ns | 270 ns | 50 ns |
| 31 | 3.7 µs | 1.6 µs | 0.39 µs |
| 61 | 13.3 µs | 6.4 µs | 1.4 µs |

The composite kernel likewise seeds a recurrence per `j1` and the radix-4/3
kernels per recursion level. For n = 1000 (= 8 · 5 · 5 · 5) roughly 1 800
`sincospi` evaluations happen per execution, on a transform FFTW finishes in
10 µs. The recurrence also costs accuracy: in `Float32`, FFTA's error against a
`Float64` reference grows from 10 ulp at 2^16 to ~1000 ulp (1.3e-4
relative) at 2^22, while FFTW stays at ~1.5 ulp (the upstream accuracy test
stops at 2^18). `Float64` stays within 3e-14. **Fix:** store per-node
twiddle tables in the `CallGraph` at plan time (this is what a plan is
for), computed directly with `sincospi` so they are correctly rounded.
Memory cost is ≤ n complex numbers per node, i.e. comparable to the
workspace FFTA already allocates. Expected gain: 2–5× on every size with a
prime factor ≥ 5, ~10–20% on powers of 2/3, and `Float32` accuracy back to
a few ulp.

### 4.2 Small transforms are O(n²) loops, not codelets

Even with tables, the O(n²) leaf is 1.6× (n = 5) to 4.6× (n = 61) slower
than FFTW's codelet, and every composite size in the smooth class bottoms
out in such leaves. The experiment in §5.2 shows that Julia can generate
straight-line codelets that match FFTW within 1.0–1.7× for n ≤ 256.
**Fix:** `@generated` codelets keyed on `Val{n}` for the small prime leaves
(5, 7, 11, 13) and for the power-of-two base cases (8/16/32/64), selected by
the planner. Radix-5 and radix-7 *butterflies* (the analogue of
`fft_pow3!`) would remove the composite-node overhead for 5^a and 7^b
factors entirely (upstream issue #105 discusses this).

### 4.3 The power-of-two kernel recurses to 2- and 4-point base cases

FFTA is 2.3–4.4× slower than FFTW for cache-resident powers of two (7× at
n = 32), and the ratio is roughly flat across 2^4…2^14, i.e. it is
per-butterfly cost, not memory traffic. Odd powers of two (whose radix-4
recursion ends in a radix-2 step) are consistently worse than even ones
(4.2–4.4× vs 3.1×). Causes, in decreasing order: (i) the recursion bottoms out at
n = 2 or 4, so half the work is function-call and index arithmetic;
(ii) three recurrence steps per butterfly instead of loads from a table;
(iii) no SIMD (see §5.3). At n ≥ 2^18 both libraries are memory-bound and
the ratio drops to 1.0–1.5× against `ESTIMATE` plans — but see §5.4. **Fix:** stop the recursion at a 16/32/64-point
straight-line base case (§5.2 measures 1.0–1.1× of FFTW at 16 and 64),
load twiddles from the plan, and consider a radix-8 pass to reduce passes
over memory for the large sizes.

### 4.4 Bluestein allocates and recomputes on every call

For n = 1009 (207 µs vs FFTW's 54 µs):

| component | time |
|:--|--:|
| `prealloc_blue` (3 × 2048-element allocations + chirp via `cispi`) | 23 µs |
| three 2048-point radix-4 transforms | 3 × 56 µs |
| everything else | ~15 µs |

One of the three transforms is the chirp's, which depends only on n and
direction. **Fix:** precompute chirp, its transform and the scratch
buffers in the plan (saves ≈ 40%); pad to the smallest *smooth* length
≥ 2n−1 instead of a power of two once the composite path is fast (FFTW pads
1009 to 2025 where FFTA uses 2048 — similar — but pads 4099 to 8640 where
FFTA uses 16384, and 65537 to a Rader plan where FFTA uses 262144). Expected: 2–3× on primes ≥ 73 and
on the "awkward" class. In the composite path (`fft_composite!`) the
scratch *is* hoisted, but re-allocated per outer call, so batched/ND
transforms with a Bluestein factor still allocate ~n × 48 bytes per pencil.

### 4.5 The Bluestein cutoff (73) is too high, and Rader is absent

The O(n²) leaf at n = 61 costs 13 µs (6.4 µs with tables); Bluestein at 73
costs 16 µs. FFTW does both in 1.4–1.7 µs using Rader's algorithm, which
maps a prime-length DFT onto a (n−1)-length convolution — n−1 is even and
usually smooth. **Fix:** after 4.1/4.2, re-tune the cutoff (likely ~20–30),
and add Rader for primes whose n−1 is smooth. Rader is not required for
the ceiling in §6 but is the difference between 2–3× and ~1.5× on primes.

### 4.6 Real transforms

The 1D even-`rfft` path is structurally right (half-length complex +
butterfly): at n = 4096 the complex half-transform is 85% of the time and
the butterfly plus output allocation 15%. So `rfft` mostly inherits the
complex gap, plus: (i) plans implement `*` only, so there is no
zero-allocation path and `mul!`-based consumers (DSP.jl's `fftfilt`,
periodograms) cannot use a preallocated output; (ii) odd lengths and 2D run
a full complex transform (2× the work); (iii) along `dims` of a matrix the
`mapslices` path allocates per column and is 10× slower than FFTW, versus
3–6× for the complex `dims` path. **Fix:** `mul!` for real plans, a
strided/batched real path that reuses the complex `fft_along_dim!` loop,
and the odd-length / 2D cases via the same half-length trick.

### 4.7 Multidimensional execution

2D 256×256: 2.2× FFTW, of which ~80% is the 512 pencil transforms (i.e. the
1D gap) and ~20% is the copy-in/copy-out through `ibuf`/`obuf`, which are
also allocated per call (8 KiB for 256², up to 2 × n × 16 bytes). At small
sizes the per-pencil overhead dominates: 8×8 is 13×, 8×8×8 is 15×, 32×32
is 11× FFTW. Composite 2D sizes inherit the 1D composite gap (1000×1000:
10×, 720×480: 8×), and 2D `rfft` — a full complex transform plus copies —
is 6–25×. Sizes with a Bluestein factor allocate 6–10 MiB per call
(1009×64, 127×257). FFTW
transforms strided pencils in place (its "vrank" plans) and batches
several columns per codelet call. **Fix:** allocate buffers in the plan,
transform contiguous dimension-1 pencils directly (the kernels already take
strides; `fft_along_dim!` copies even when the pencil is contiguous), and
thread across pencils (§5.6).

### 4.8 API and dispatch issues found while benchmarking

* Loading FFTW.jl and FFTA.jl together makes `plan_rfft(::Vector{Float64},
  ::Int)` — and hence `rfft(x)` — a **method ambiguity error**, because
  FFTA annotates `region::RegionTypes` while FFTW annotates the array as
  `StridedArray`. Neither package is "more specific". This breaks any
  environment that has both loaded (e.g. a DSP.jl user trying FFTA).
* No `mul!` for real plans (only `*`), which is what DSP.jl uses at 10 of
  its 13 plan-execution sites; `mul!` into a `SubArray` output fails even
  for complex plans.
* No in-place plans (`plan_fft!`, `plan_bfft!`, hence `ifft!`).
* `inv(p)` throws a `TypeError` rather than working or giving a clean
  `MethodError`: FFTA defines no `AbstractFFTs.plan_inv` method, and the
  dummy `pinv::FFTAInvPlan` field makes `AbstractFFTs.inv`'s
  `pinv_type(p)` resolve to `Union{}`. Consequently `p \ x` and `ldiv!`
  are unavailable too.
* `plan_rfft`/`plan_brfft` for 3D arrays throw (DSP.jl's `conv` is tested
  for N = 3).
* The region argument is not inferred (`plan_fft(x, 2)` returns a plan
  whose type depends on `region`'s run-time type; upstream #78/#91).
* `Float32` transforms are exactly as slow as `Float64` (no SIMD), while
  FFTW is 1.75× faster in single precision.

## 5. Structural limits

### 5.1 No measuring planner

FFTA chooses a factorization by a fixed rule. FFTW's `ESTIMATE` mode also
does not measure; on this machine `MEASURE` improves `ESTIMATE` by 0–25% for
powers of two. FFTA could adopt FFTW's heuristics (radix-32/16 first,
codelet sizes at the bottom) without timing anything. A timing planner is
implementable in Julia (it is just a loop over candidate call graphs at plan
time), but its value is small and its plan-time cost large (FFTW `MEASURE`
takes seconds at 2^22). **Verdict: not a real limit.** Plan creation is
actually an FFTA advantage: FFTA plans in 0.1–30 µs, FFTW `ESTIMATE` in
2 µs–190 ms (large primes are slow: 10 ms at n = 120 779, 190 ms at
1 727 797) and `MEASURE` in milliseconds to seconds; consumers that plan
per call (DSP.jl does this in several places) benefit, and one-shot
`fft(x)` on large primes is within 1.5–2× of FFTW today.

### 5.2 Codelets and Julia's compilation model

FFTW ships ~150 pre-generated codelets per SIMD flavour. In Julia the
equivalent is an `@generated` function keyed on `Val{n}` that emits
straight-line code. A 40-line generator (radix-2 DIT, every intermediate in
its own SSA variable, twiddles folded to constants) gives, on this machine:

| n | statements | compile (first call) | codelet | FFTA today | FFTW | codelet / FFTW |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 8 | 52 | 0.02 s | 16 ns | 114 ns | 26 ns | 0.61 |
| 16 | 128 | 0.05 s | 43 ns | 148 ns | 41 ns | 1.05 |
| 32 | 304 | 0.17 s | 128 ns | 584 ns | 80 ns | 1.61 |
| 64 | 704 | 0.62 s | 341 ns | 817 ns | 309 ns | 1.10 |
| 128 | 1 600 | 2.5 s | 875 ns | 2.75 µs | 644 ns | 1.36 |
| 256 | 3 584 | 6.8 s | 2.27 µs | 4.05 µs | 1.31 µs | 1.73 |
| 5 (O(n²)) | — | 0.03 s | 31 ns | 179 ns | 22 ns | 1.39 |
| 7 (O(n²)) | — | 0.05 s | 68 ns | 301 ns | 26 ns | 2.60 |
| 13 (O(n²)) | — | 0.18 s | 264 ns | 819 ns | 48 ns | 5.5 |

So: **codelets up to 64 points are within 1.0–1.6× of FFTW and compile in
under a second**; LLVM's compile time grows super-linearly beyond that
(a naive O(n²) 64-point unroll took 39 s), so the codelet set must be small
and fixed (e.g. 2–64 for powers of two, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 25), with the
generic recursion above it. The compile cost is paid once per (n, T) per
Julia session unless the package precompiles them with `PrecompileTools`
(then it is paid once at package install, ~10–30 s for the set above, and
the package's precompile cache grows by a few MB). This is the structural
cost of "planner-like behaviour" in Julia: **a fixed codelet set with
precompilation, not per-size specialisation** — an arbitrary size like 1009
must still be built from the fixed set at run time, exactly as FFTW does.
The O(n²) codelets for 11 and 13 remain 5× off because FFTW's are
Winograd/Rader-derived with far fewer multiplications; those algorithms can
be generated too but are more work.

### 5.3 SIMD on interleaved complex data

On this CPU a NEON register is 128 bits = one `ComplexF64`, so SIMD gains
for double precision must come from operating on *two independent
butterflies* per instruction (FFTW's `*v_*` codelets) or from split
real/imaginary storage. LLVM does not do this transformation for scalar
straight-line code: the `ComplexF32` codelet in §5.2 is no faster than the
`ComplexF64` one, while FFTW's is 1.6× faster. Reaching it in Julia means
explicit `SIMD.jl`/`VectorizationBase` vectors in the codelet generator, or
vectorising across pencils in ND/batched transforms (each lane a different
column — the easy and big win for the downstream use case). On AVX2/AVX-512
x86-64 the same argument applies with 2–4 `ComplexF64` per register, so the
FFTA/FFTW gap on x86-64 is expected to be *larger* than the aarch64 numbers
here until this is done. **Verdict: the last ~1.3–2× on cache-resident
sizes is structural until FFTA has an explicitly vectorised kernel
generator; it is not blocked by the language.**

### 5.4 Memory-bound regime

For n ≥ 2^18 (4 MiB of `ComplexF64`) FFTA is within 1.0–1.5× of FFTW's
`ESTIMATE` plans, which is misleading: FFTW's `MEASURE` plans are 2.2–2.8×
faster than its `ESTIMATE` plans in this regime, so the gap to the best
FFTW plan is ~2.5–3×. What `MEASURE` finds is a decomposition with fewer
passes over DRAM (large radices, in-place transposes, buffered
sub-transforms — the "four-step"/cache-blocked family). FFTA's depth-first
radix-4 recursion is cache-oblivious to a degree but its twiddle pass at
each level touches the whole array. Closing this needs a cache-blocked
large-n path (transform as an n₁×n₂ matrix with a transpose step and
contiguous sub-transforms) — algorithmically standard, and independent of
SIMD. This is fixable but is a new code path rather than a tweak.

### 5.5 Primes

Asymptotically both approaches are O(n log n) via Bluestein; FFTW's
constant is better because of smooth padding and a stored chirp transform,
and Rader wins when n−1 is smooth. After §4.4/4.5, primes should sit at
2–3× the cost of a same-size smooth transform in both libraries, i.e. a
1.5–3× ratio. **No structural limit** beyond §5.3.

### 5.6 Threading

FFTW threads *inside* one transform (splitting radix passes). FFTA has no
threading, and its `CallGraph` owns a single workspace, so a plan is not
safe to share between threads. Threading across independent pencils in ND
and batched transforms is straightforward (one workspace per thread) and
gives near-linear speedups for the dominant signal-processing pattern
(`fft(X, 1)` over many columns). Threading within a single 1D transform
needs a breadth-first pass structure, which is a bigger restructuring.
FFTW with 8 threads is 5–12× faster than with one on n ≥ 2^16, 2D ≥ 256²
and batched matrices (see `REPORT.md`, threading section), leaving FFTA
7–20× behind in those configurations. For downstream signal-processing
users the batched and ND cases are the ones that matter, and those are the
easy ones to thread.

### 5.7 Generic element types

FFTA's selling point — `Complex{BigFloat}`, dual numbers, symbolic
elements — is preserved by every fix above as long as the codelet path is
gated on `isbitstype` / `T <: Union{Float32,Float64}` and the generic
recursion remains the fallback. This constrains the design (two code paths)
but not the ceiling.

## 6. Realistic ceiling

Combining §4 and §5 (single-threaded, this machine; x86-64 with AVX2/512
will show larger ratios until §5.3 is addressed):

| class | today (vs `ESTIMATE`) | after §4.1–4.7 (no SIMD) | with vectorised codelets |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| 2^k in cache | 2.3–4.4× | 1.5–2× | 1.1–1.5× |
| 2^k memory-bound (vs `MEASURE`) | 2.5–3× | 1.5–2× (needs the blocked path of §5.4) | 1.2–1.5× |
| smooth composites | 2.6–15× | 1.5–3× | 1.2–2× |
| primes / awkward | 3–11× | 2–3× | 1.5–2.5× |
| `rfft` | 1.4–25× | 1.5–2.5× | 1.2–2× |
| 2D/3D/batched, 1 thread | 1.2–25× | 1.3–2× | 1.1–1.5× |
| 2D/3D/batched vs FFTW 8 threads | 7–20× | ~1.5–2× with pencil threading | ~1.2–1.5× |

"1.5–3× of FFTW across the sweep" is achievable without SIMD work; getting
under 1.5× everywhere needs the vectorised generator. A 10× gap is
**nowhere unavoidable**; the sizes where it exists today (5- and 7-smooth
composites, primes) are exactly the ones fixed by storing twiddles and
codelets, i.e. by making the plan carry the work a plan is supposed to
carry.

## 7. Recommendation for downstream projects today

Until the fixes land: FFTA is a reasonable substitute for 1D power-of-two
transforms (within 2.3–4.4× in cache, 1.0–1.5× of FFTW-`ESTIMATE` above
2^18); it is a poor substitute (5–15×) for sizes with factors of 5 or 7,
for primes, for small 2D/3D arrays and for 2D `rfft`, and its `rfft` along
`dims` should be avoided. Since signal-processing consumers overwhelmingly use
power-of-two `nfft` (Welch, periodograms, `fftfilt`) the practical cost is
the 2–5× on `rfft`, plus the ambiguity in §4.8 which must be fixed before
FFTA and FFTW can coexist in one environment at all.

## 8. Work list (one PR each)

1. Store twiddle tables and Bluestein chirp/scratch in the plan (§4.1, §4.4).
2. `mul!` for real plans; zero-allocation `rfft`/`irfft`; `dims` path for
   real transforms without `mapslices` (§4.6).
3. Straight-line base cases for the power-of-two kernel (16/32/64) and
   codelets for 3/5/7 leaves; radix-5/7 butterflies (§4.2, §4.3).
4. Plan-owned ND buffers, contiguous-pencil fast path, threading across
   pencils (§4.7, §5.6).
